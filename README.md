#Lydia Pleshkova

Being an experienced employee who worked in a number of large international companies, I can perfectly work independently and as a team player. I’ve earned **BA in Linguistics and Interpreting** and **LLM in Civil Law**. Now I'm taking two online courses - **'Quality Assurance Engineer'** and **'Data Scientist'**, planning to become a *pythonista data science ninja with QA skills*.

In addition, I'm truly proud to be a **pro bono researcher** in the Human Rights Organization ‘Memorial’ (Nobel Peace Prize laureate), doing archival documentary research on life and career of people who drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948. 

My technical competences are as follows: MS Office, Zoom, Outlook, Lotus Notes, **Python**, and various internal systems and databases (CRM, iManage, CD Entry, etc.). 

Besides, I'm an **active traveler** (visited many beautiful countries, such as Ireland, Switzerland, Scandinavian countries, Canada, ect.) and a passionate reader of nonfiction historical texts.
